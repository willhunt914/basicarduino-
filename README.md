# basicarduino-

we are learning how to use an arduino and code using the software 

asignments 
[helloarduino](https://create.arduino.cc/editor/whunt29a/039797c1-b686-4826-aefa-956df684e6c4)

This is the first asignment this is teaching us the basics 
I learned the basics to arduino and how to wire a circuit.

This makes the led blink 5 times

this asignment should blink whevever you press the button this is the basic teaching of how to usea pushbotton and wire up a breadboard 
I learned how to use a pushbutton and a more advanced knowlege of how to use an led

this is simelar to the button activated led but with two buttons and two leds instead
I learned how to use multiple push puttons on a breadboard. 

Final project: This week I worked on the final project it is an adition to the servo controll coding asignment but with more freedom.
You use onshape to design a holder for your servo control.

This week I finished the final project code. 

# Revision 

This was the hardest project yet. For the first 3 asignments it was pretty simple but after that is was substancially. I stuggled with it beacause it was a less rigid descrption than other asignments that we had done in the past.  I did like this though I think that it made me learn more. This is the first project that I had to get help to fix my code. Because this was my first time using an arduino sometimes I would have to look up what was wrong with my code. Overall even though i t was dificult I enjoyed this.
