we are learning how to use an arduino and code using the software 

asignments

This makes the led blink 5 times

this asignment should blink whevever you press the button this is the basic teaching of how to usea pushbotton and wire up a breadboard 
I learned how to use a pushbutton and a more advanced knowlege of how to use an led

this is simelar to the button activated led but with two buttons and two leds instead
I learned how to use multiple push puttons on a breadboard. 

Final project: This week I worked on the final project it is an adition to the servo controll coding asignment but with more freedom.
You use onshape to design a holder for your servo control.
